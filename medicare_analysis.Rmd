#### A report prepared to describe Medicare Providers in Warren County

##### 

# Introduction

Medicare is a federal system of health insurance for individuals aged 65 and over, certain young people with disabilities, and individuals with End-Stage Renal disease. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Medicare does not include Medicaid, which is a joint state and federal program designed to provide medical cost assistance to individuals with limited income and resources.

# Methods

This report is generated using a series of datasets from various public datasets. These data have been accessed in the most raw version of
data that is available or the data was retrieved from a web API. This ensures
that analyses that are conducted are being done on the original data and are not
calculations based on the calculations of others.

All of the code for the generation of these reports is developed using the R
Statistical Programming Language [@R-Project] and the R Studio IDE [@R-Studio].
The code used for the development of this report is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/DustinRatliff/medicare_analysis). A copy of this report
will be maintained on the Warren County Health District
[website](http://warrenchd.com/document-category/assessments).

### Data Analysis

Primary care physicians are primarily situated in the highly-populated areas of Springboro, Mason, and Lebanon. There are few providers that are located in the rural areas of the county. Overlaying the Medicare Primary Care Providers onto a map of Warren County with the percentage of the population aged 65 and over demonstrates that there are large areas of the county with a large percentage of the population aged 65+ with no medicare primary care providers in the area.

### What services are wanted in the community?

During the 2016 Community Health Assessment, the Community Themes and Strengths subcommittee collected survey responses to ascertain what is important in the community, how the quality of life is perceived, and assets to improve community health. Questions were developed using the Mobilizing Partnerships through Partnerships and Planning manual. These questions are comparable to any other community that has utilized the MAPP process to develop a Community Themes and Strengths Assessment. The following questions were developed:

* What services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?
* What classes/education programs or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?
* What community health resources or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?
* What economic resources or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?
* What safety/environmental resources or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?
* What other issues or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?

Responses to the survey questions were compiled into a single space. The data was then analyzed via qualitative data methodologies. 

Each response to the six questions were analyzed to assess similiar themes and categories throughout the responses. As a result of these analysis, 12 categories were developed:

* Public Safety
* Underserved Services
* Environmental
* Community Activities
* Youth Issues
* Substance Abuse and Awareness
* Employment
* Transportation
* Wellness
* Senior Services
* Information and Referral
* Other

```

Based on the qualitative analysis of these data, 2.6% of the responses to the CTSA survey questions were related to senior services. Out of all of the 1,216 individual repsonses to the survey, only one discussed the word "Medicare". The citation of "accept Medicare" was in repsonse to the question "What community health resources or services would make your community a healthier, better place to live?" The repsponse to this question indicates that the respondent found it easy to find providers that accepted Medicare in Warren County.

Additional analysis was conducted on the online customer survey repsonses to the 2019 Regional Community Health Needs Assessment facilitated by the Health Collaborative. None of the repsonses from Warren County discussed Medicare. Three responses discussed affordable healthcare for senior citizens.
