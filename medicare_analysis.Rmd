#### A report prepared to describe Medicare Providers in Warren County

##### 

# Introduction

Medicare is a federal system of health insurance for individuals aged 65 and over, certain young people with disabilities, and individuals with End-Stage Renal disease. The program is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Medicare does not include Medicaid, which is a joint state and federal program designed to provide medical cost assistance to individuals with limited income and resources.

# Methods

This report is generated using a series of datasets from various public datasets. These data have been accessed in the most raw version of
data that is available or the data was retrieved from a web API. This ensures
that analyses that are conducted are being done on the original data and are not
calculations based on the calculations of others.

All of the code for the generation of these reports is developed using the R
Statistical Programming Language [@R-Project] and the R Studio IDE [@R-Studio].
The code used for the development of this report is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/DustinRatliff/medicare_analysis). A copy of this report
will be maintained on the Warren County Health District
[website](http://warrenchd.com/document-category/assessments).
